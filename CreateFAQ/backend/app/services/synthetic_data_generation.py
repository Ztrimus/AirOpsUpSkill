# Generate description, transcription, and summary using Gemini
def generate_text_fields_with_gemini(job):
    prompt = f"""
You are tasked with generating realistic repair documentation for a repair job, which may have one of the following outcomes and choose only one outcome from the following:
1. Correct/Successful repair.
2. Failed repair attempt.
3. Successful repair but through an alternate method.
4. Failed repair attempt with steps differing from the planned repair process.

Given the following repair job details, generate:
1. A detailed description of the issue, specifying what went wrong with the equipment.
2. A verbal transcription of the technician’s commentary during the repair process, reflecting their observations, actions, and decisions.
3. A step-by-step summary of the repair process, including deviations (if any) from the planned steps.

**Repair Job Details:**
- Ticket ID: {job["ticket_id"]}
- Manufacturing Plant: {job["manufacturing_plant_id"]}
- Machine Type: {job["machine_type"]}
- Machine ID: {job["machine_id"]}
- Job Type: {job["job_type"]}
- Planned Repair Steps: {job["repair_steps"]}

**Output Format:**
Please provide the output in JSON format with the following fields:
{{
  "Description": "Detailed description of the issue",
  "Transcription": "Verbal transcription of the technician’s commentary",
  "Summary Steps": "Step-by-step summary of the repair process"
}}

**Examples of Repair Outcomes:**
1. Correct Repair: The planned steps were followed successfully, and the issue was resolved.
2. Failed Repair: The planned steps were executed, but the issue could not be resolved due to unforeseen complications.
3. Alternate Success: The repair succeeded, but alternate methods or steps were required.
4. Failure with Deviations: The repair failed, and the actual steps differed significantly from the planned ones.

Make sure the output is valid JSON and adheres to the specified format.
